we have studied the problem of blind estimation of non-integer OSR for bursty communication. Through theoretical analysis, we found that when the signal duration is lower than 100 symbols, the “OSR peak” position detected by the conventional cyclostationary method deviates from the correct peak position, due to the existence of two bias factors, i.e., the “finite window direct current (DC) bias” and the “finite window non-DC bias”.
